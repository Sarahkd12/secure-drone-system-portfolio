# Secure Drone Communication System – Portfolio Overview  
### By Sarah Aldhbaie

This repository contains a **public overview** of my Secure Drone Communication System project.  
The full source code is kept private to protect academic work, but this page explains the idea, features,  
and my role in the project.

## 🚀 Project Summary

This project simulates secure communication between a **drone** and a **control centre** using Java.  
It demonstrates:

- Diffie–Hellman key exchange  
- Caesar Cipher encryption & decryption (ASCII-based)  
- A menu-driven console interface  
- Realistic communication flow between both sides  

The system encrypts each message before sending, and decrypts it upon receiving,  
mimicking how secure communication works in real-life scenarios.

## 👩‍💻 My Contribution

I worked on:

### 🔐 **1. Encryption & Decryption Logic**
- Implemented the encryption and decryption functions using an ASCII Caesar Cipher.
- Integrated the cipher with the generated Diffie–Hellman key.

### 💬 **2. Interaction Flow**
I took the initiative to make the system more interactive by adding:

- Conversation flow between the drone and control centre  
- Question/response prompts  
- Scenarios that feel realistic  
- Dynamic user-driven choices  

This turned the project from a simple encryption demo into a more engaging communication simulation.

### 🧭 **3. Console Menu & User Interface**
- Designed the menu structure  
- Wrote the user prompts  
- Structured the message flow for both sides
